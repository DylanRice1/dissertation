# Floating Waste Detection
This project was created and submitted as my university dissertation. The main idea behing this project was to use a dataset of litter images, taken from every day situations as opposed to in-situ contexts, to train and apply computer vision models to marine waste identification.

## Project Aims
The aims of this project were:
- Train CNN models using general waste images for the purpose of marine waste detection.
- Evaluate the performance of models trained on general data for specific tasks.
- Help propose current, exisiting technological solutions for major environmental issues.

## Methodology
The approach of this solution consisted of two major areas:
- A dataset of waste images in everday settings.
- Evidencing the effectiveness of CNN model's, trained on generalised datasets, applied to the specific task of marine waste detection.

### The Dataset
The dataset of waste images was taken from Kaggle and created by Suman Kunwar and thierrytheg. The dataset consists of
