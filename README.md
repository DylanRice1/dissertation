# Floating Waste Detection
This project was created and submitted as my university dissertation. The main idea behing this project was to use a dataset of litter images, taken from every day situations as opposed to in-situ contexts, to train and apply computer vision models to marine waste identification.

## Project Aims
The aims of this project were:
- Train CNN models using general waste images for the purpose of marine waste detection.
- Evaluate the performance of models trained on general data for specific tasks.
- Help propose current, exisiting technological solutions for major environmental issues.
